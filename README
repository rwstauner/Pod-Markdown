NAME
    Pod::Markdown - Convert POD to Markdown

SYNOPSIS
        my $parser = Pod::Markdown->new;
        $parser->parse_from_filehandle(\*STDIN);
        print $parser->as_markdown;

DESCRIPTION
    This module subclasses Pod::Parser and converts POD to Markdown.

METHODS
    "initialize"
        Initializes a newly constructed object.

    "as_markdown"
        Returns the parsed POD as Markdown. Takes named arguments. If the
        "with_meta" argument is given a positive value, meta tags are
        generated as well.

    "command"
        Handles POD command paragraphs, denoted by a line beginning with
        "=".

    "verbatim"
        Handles verbatim text.

    "textblock"
        Handles normal blocks of POD.

    "interior_sequence"
        Handles interior sequences in POD. An interior sequence is an
        embedded command within a block of text which appears as a command
        name - usually a single uppercase character - followed immediately
        by a string of text which is enclosed in angle brackets.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    *   Doesn't create pure Markdown texts.

    *   The links to manpages are incomplete.
