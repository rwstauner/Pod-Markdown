## Unordered

- This

- a

    basic

- bulleted

    item

- list
- test
- and _Italics_, **Bold**, `Code`, and [Links](pod:Links) should work in list item

    and _in_ **paragraph** `after` [item](pod:item)

- verbatim paragraphs

        need double-indent inside lists

## Unordered nested list

**Note:** Markdown does not support definition lists (word => text), just bullets or numbers

- Head1

    Paragraph should be indented.
    \* And escaped.

    - Head2

        Paragraph should be indented.

- Head1

    Paragraph should be indented.

## Unordered nested huddled list

- This is a list head.
- This is a list head, too.
    - Again, this is a list head.
- Finally, this is also a list head.

And

- A list item
\\with a line that starts with a markdown char.
- item 2

## Ordered
