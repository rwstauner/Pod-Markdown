1.991-TRIAL 2014-01-03T04:07:49Z

  [Test Fixes]
  - Ignore worthless testing of empty links that fail with Pod::Simple 3.16.

1.990-TRIAL 2014-01-02T14:13:40Z

  [Enhancements]
  - Change backend from Pod::Parser to Pod::Simple.
    Previous documented API has been ported
    however the Pod::Simple API should be preferred for new code.
  - Improve escaping of markdown characters.
  - Accept for/begin 'markdown' and 'html' regions by default.
  - Represent over/back regions without items as blockquotes.

  [Backward Incompatible Changes]
  - E<> codes used to produce equivalent html entities (&foo;).
    These now simply print the corresponding unicode character as utf-8.
    If you desire alternate behavior please report a bug.
  - Tabs are now expanded.

1.500     2013-11-22T15:05:31Z

    - Format url fragments (in links to perldoc sections)
      according to the destination site (perldoc_url_prefix).
      This makes links to sections work where they probably never did before.
      They are also customizable.

    - Use multiple backticks to delimit code spans
      that contain literal backticks.

1.401     2013-11-06T05:30:55Z

    - Require Pod::Parser 1.51 for bug fixes.

1.400     2013-11-05T14:18:19Z

    [Output Changes]
    - Change perldoc urls to point to metacpan.

    [Bug Fixes]
    - Recognize numbered pod items that do not have a period.
      Thanks to Yasutaka ATARASHI for the pull request (gh-4).
    - Remove extraneous blank line between verbatim paragraphs.
      Thanks to Graham Ollis for the pull request (gh-5).
    - Do not escape markdown characters inside links (or file paths).
      Thanks to Taiki Kawakami for the pull request (gh-6).

1.322     2012-11-17T15:51:36Z

    - Fix incorrect escaping of characters
      that are inside inline code blocks in headers.
      Thanks to Peter Vereshagin for the pull req (gh-3).

1.321     2012-10-27T01:23:56Z

    - Improved list handling including support for ordered (numbered)
      and nested lists.
      Thanks to Yasutaka ATARASHI for the pull req (gh-2).

1.320     2012-04-30T23:30:11Z

    - End markdown output with a newline to be more consistent with...
      everything.  If this causes a problem for you please report it.

    - Enable pod2markdown to accept file paths as arguments
      (for both input and output (defaulting to STDIN/STDOUT)).
      Thanks to Mike Doherty for the suggestion [rt-76726].

1.301     2012-04-25T03:56:11Z

    - Fix double-interpolation of list headings
      which caused escaping of the markdown characters.
      Thanks to motemen for the pull request (gh-1).

    - Add TODO tests for improving list handling.

1.300000  2012-04-08T00:08:25Z

    - Document that characters in varbatim paragraphs and code sections
      are not escaped.
    - Bump release number to demonstrate major formatting difference
      of last change (backslash-escaped characters).
      (Forgot to do it last time.)

1.200001  2012-04-07T23:16:23Z

    - Escape characters that are special to Markdown
      (but normal in Pod) with backslashes.
      Thanks to Florian (fschlich at zedat dot fu-berlin dot de)
      for the initial patch (rt-75620).

1.200000  2011-11-28T17:57:01Z
    [Enhancements]
    - Handle POD formatting codes embedded in links
    - Render Z<> and X<> as blank strings
    - Handle numeric (hex, octal, and decimal) E<> escapes
    - Convert spaces in S<> to &nbsp;

    [Format Changes]
    - S<> no longer produces backticks (code sections).
      This is consistent with perlpod and perlpodspec.
      Use something like S<C<$x + $y>> if you intend it to be treated as code.
    - Author meta tag with no title meta tag does not produce a leading newline.
      This was considered a bug.

    [Tests]
    - More tests, increased coverage

1.120001  2011-11-27T04:07:30Z
    [Prereqs]
    - Require version 1.10 of Pod::ParseLink (core in perl 5.12)
      to handle alt text with schemes/absolute URLs.
      This can be changed from "requires" to "recommends" if it poses a problem.

    [Test Fix]
    - Skip tests (rather than fail) for alt text with absolute url
      if Pod::ParseLink < 1.10

1.120000  2011-11-19T05:44:51Z
    [Enhancements]
    - Use Pod::ParseLink to dramatically improve (and simplify) link parsing
      (including sections, alternate text, and man pages).

    [Format Change]
    - NOTE: L</foo> now becomes ["foo"](#foo) instead of [foo](#pod_foo).
      This is consistent with perldoc, perlpodspec, and Pod::Simple::(X)HTML
      which is used for metacpan.org and search.cpan.org.
      No '#pod_' id/name attributes were ever generated so the links
      probably weren't very useful (and probably still aren't).
      If this change presents a problem please report it.

1.110732  2011-11-18T04:06:06Z
    - Change /\h/ to /[ \t]/ for compatibility with older perls.
      Thanks to David Golden for reporting [rt-71961]

1.110731  2011-11-18T03:28:34Z
    - Ensure verbatim pod becomes verbatim markdown
      by increasing indentation if necessary [rt-72414]
    - Co-maintainership granted to RWSTAUNER

1.110730  2011-03-14 10:11:52 Europe/Vienna
    - make bulleted lists work at least minimally (thanks ap)

1.103491  2010-12-15 23:03:02 Europe/Vienna
    - added Ryan C. Thompson's email address

1.103490  2010-12-15 16:12:31 Europe/Vienna
    - improved L<> link handling
    - Enabled interpolation of I<these thingies> in headers

1.100860  2010-03-27 14:31:43 Europe/Vienna
    - converted the distribution to Dist::Zilla-style
    - bin/pod2markdown now uses '#!/usr/bin/env perl'

0.02 2009-10-04 16:30:06 CEST
    - E<foo> now outputs '&foo;'
    - only generate meta tags if asked to

0.01  2009-10-04T12:24:45Z (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
    - original version
