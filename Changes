3.400     2023-10-29T18:55:47Z

  - Add CLI options for local-module, man, and perldoc url prefixes.
    Thanks josch! (gh-25)

3.300     2020-10-31T22:57:42Z

  - Add escape_url option to allow disabling it (defaults to true).
    Thanks plicease! (gh-19)

3.200     2019-10-09T16:36:15Z

  - Allow local_module_url_prefix to be '' [rt-129865].
  - URI Escape the module name in external pod links
    (introduces dependency on URI::Escape).

3.101     2018-08-06T14:32:38Z

  - Ensure local_module_url_prefix defaults to current perldoc_url_prefix.

3.100     2018-08-06T02:07:18Z

  - Add "local_module_url_prefix" and "local_module_re" args
    to allow pointing links for local modules to another site [rt-120452].

3.005     2016-03-06T02:51:24Z

  - Fix pod.

3.004     2016-03-06T02:22:21Z

  - Leave email addresses (<foo@bar.com>) in tact for Markdown to process.
    Thanks to Andreas Boesen for reporting [rt-112631].

3.003     2015-09-28T00:29:45Z

  - Bump Pod::Simple prereq to fix bugs that were causing test failures.
  - Use Pod::Simple's nbsp_for_S(1) by default instead of handling S<> sequences internally.
    This means the feature can now also be disabled if desired.
  - Portability improvements for non-ascii platforms.

3.002     2015-08-21T03:24:24Z

  - Add attribution to changelog.

3.001     2015-08-21T03:17:57Z

  - Increase Pod::Simple requirement to 3.26 for detected_encoding().
    Thanks to Lee J for reporting! (gh-15).

3.000     2015-08-16T21:55:14Z

  [Bug Fixes]
  - Literal ampersands and left angle brackets are encoded as html entities
    when necessary to avoid interpretation as html.
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28496298/escape-angle-brackets-using-podmarkdown

  [API Changes]
  - Make accessors read/write (instead of read-only)
    for consistency with Pod::Simple classes.
  - Passing unknown arguments to the constructor now produces a warning
    and in the future may throw an error.
  - For consistency with the other html-entity changes, NBSP characters (U+00A0)
    are now used literally for S<> sequences.
    This also fixes a bug with code spans nested inside of S<> sequences.

  [New Attributes]
  - Add `html_encode_chars` attribute to allow customizing what characters
    should be html entity encoded.
  - Add `match_encoding` attribute to use the same encoding as the input pod
    when writing to the output handle.
  - Add `output_encoding` attribute to specify the desired encoding
    to apply to the output handle.

  [pod2markdown script]
  - Add command line options corresponding to new module attributes.
  - The script now defaults to UTF-8 encoding if no encoding options are specified.
    Previous versions did not produce consistent output and would sometimes emit warnings.
    Closes gh-14 and rt-101536.

  [Documentation]
  - Remove documentation for deprecated API
    (parse_from_file(), parse_from_filehandle(), and as_markdown())
    to further discourage use.

  [New Packages]
  - Added Pod::Perldoc::ToMarkdown to enable `perldoc -o Markdown ...`
    Pod::Markdown maintains a backward compatible interface that is incompatible
    with perldoc's `-o` so this module has been added to enable the functionality.
    Thanks to Alberto Sim√µes for investigating (gh-12) and providing some code to fix it (gh-13).

2.002     2014-07-05T15:20:40Z

  - Docs: Add example of command line usage to Synopsis.
    Thanks, Cindy Wang!

2.001     2014-04-20T02:40:11Z

  - Use double-asterisk instead of double-underscore for bold Markdown.
    This allows bold and italic to be nested without confusing parsers.
    Thanks to Mike Covington for the great pull request (gh-9)!

2.000     2014-02-01T14:38:27Z

  - Releasing previous (1.99[01]) as stable
    (now uses Pod::Simple instead of Pod::Parser).
    See below for changes.

1.991-TRIAL 2014-01-03T04:07:49Z

  [Test Fixes]
  - Ignore worthless testing of empty links that fail with Pod::Simple 3.16.

1.990-TRIAL 2014-01-02T14:13:40Z

  [Enhancements]
  - Change backend from Pod::Parser to Pod::Simple.
    Previous documented API has been ported
    however the Pod::Simple API should be preferred for new code.
  - Improve escaping of markdown characters.
  - Accept for/begin 'markdown' and 'html' regions by default.
  - Represent over/back regions without items as blockquotes.

  [Backward Incompatible Changes]
  - E<> codes used to produce equivalent html entities (&foo;).
    These now simply insert the corresponding unicode character.
    If you desire alternate behavior please report a bug.
  - Tabs are now expanded.

1.500     2013-11-22T15:05:31Z

    - Format url fragments (in links to perldoc sections)
      according to the destination site (perldoc_url_prefix).
      This makes links to sections work where they probably never did before.
      They are also customizable.

    - Use multiple backticks to delimit code spans
      that contain literal backticks.

1.401     2013-11-06T05:30:55Z

    - Require Pod::Parser 1.51 for bug fixes.

1.400     2013-11-05T14:18:19Z

    [Output Changes]
    - Change perldoc urls to point to metacpan.

    [Bug Fixes]
    - Recognize numbered pod items that do not have a period.
      Thanks to Yasutaka ATARASHI for the pull request (gh-4).
    - Remove extraneous blank line between verbatim paragraphs.
      Thanks to Graham Ollis for the pull request (gh-5).
    - Do not escape markdown characters inside links (or file paths).
      Thanks to Taiki Kawakami for the pull request (gh-6).

1.322     2012-11-17T15:51:36Z

    - Fix incorrect escaping of characters
      that are inside inline code blocks in headers.
      Thanks to Peter Vereshagin for the pull req (gh-3).

1.321     2012-10-27T01:23:56Z

    - Improved list handling including support for ordered (numbered)
      and nested lists.
      Thanks to Yasutaka ATARASHI for the pull req (gh-2).

1.320     2012-04-30T23:30:11Z

    - End markdown output with a newline to be more consistent with...
      everything.  If this causes a problem for you please report it.

    - Enable pod2markdown to accept file paths as arguments
      (for both input and output (defaulting to STDIN/STDOUT)).
      Thanks to Mike Doherty for the suggestion [rt-76726].

1.301     2012-04-25T03:56:11Z

    - Fix double-interpolation of list headings
      which caused escaping of the markdown characters.
      Thanks to motemen for the pull request (gh-1).

    - Add TODO tests for improving list handling.

1.300000  2012-04-08T00:08:25Z

    - Document that characters in varbatim paragraphs and code sections
      are not escaped.
    - Bump release number to demonstrate major formatting difference
      of last change (backslash-escaped characters).
      (Forgot to do it last time.)

1.200001  2012-04-07T23:16:23Z

    - Escape characters that are special to Markdown
      (but normal in Pod) with backslashes.
      Thanks to Florian (fschlich at zedat dot fu-berlin dot de)
      for the initial patch (rt-75620).

1.200000  2011-11-28T17:57:01Z
    [Enhancements]
    - Handle POD formatting codes embedded in links
    - Render Z<> and X<> as blank strings
    - Handle numeric (hex, octal, and decimal) E<> escapes
    - Convert spaces in S<> to &nbsp;

    [Format Changes]
    - S<> no longer produces backticks (code sections).
      This is consistent with perlpod and perlpodspec.
      Use something like S<C<$x + $y>> if you intend it to be treated as code.
    - Author meta tag with no title meta tag does not produce a leading newline.
      This was considered a bug.

    [Tests]
    - More tests, increased coverage

1.120001  2011-11-27T04:07:30Z
    [Prereqs]
    - Require version 1.10 of Pod::ParseLink (core in perl 5.12)
      to handle alt text with schemes/absolute URLs.
      This can be changed from "requires" to "recommends" if it poses a problem.

    [Test Fix]
    - Skip tests (rather than fail) for alt text with absolute url
      if Pod::ParseLink < 1.10

1.120000  2011-11-19T05:44:51Z
    [Enhancements]
    - Use Pod::ParseLink to dramatically improve (and simplify) link parsing
      (including sections, alternate text, and man pages).

    [Format Change]
    - NOTE: L</foo> now becomes ["foo"](#foo) instead of [foo](#pod_foo).
      This is consistent with perldoc, perlpodspec, and Pod::Simple::(X)HTML
      which is used for metacpan.org and search.cpan.org.
      No '#pod_' id/name attributes were ever generated so the links
      probably weren't very useful (and probably still aren't).
      If this change presents a problem please report it.

1.110732  2011-11-18T04:06:06Z
    - Change /\h/ to /[ \t]/ for compatibility with older perls.
      Thanks to David Golden for reporting [rt-71961]

1.110731  2011-11-18T03:28:34Z
    - Ensure verbatim pod becomes verbatim markdown
      by increasing indentation if necessary [rt-72414]
    - Co-maintainership granted to RWSTAUNER

1.110730  2011-03-14 10:11:52 Europe/Vienna
    - make bulleted lists work at least minimally (thanks ap)

1.103491  2010-12-15 23:03:02 Europe/Vienna
    - added Ryan C. Thompson's email address

1.103490  2010-12-15 16:12:31 Europe/Vienna
    - improved L<> link handling
    - Enabled interpolation of I<these thingies> in headers

1.100860  2010-03-27 14:31:43 Europe/Vienna
    - converted the distribution to Dist::Zilla-style
    - bin/pod2markdown now uses '#!/usr/bin/env perl'

0.02 2009-10-04 16:30:06 CEST
    - E<foo> now outputs '&foo;'
    - only generate meta tags if asked to

0.01  2009-10-04T12:24:45Z (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
    - original version
